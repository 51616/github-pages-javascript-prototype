# GitHub Pages JavaScript Prototype

_- Experimenting with GitHub pages and JavaScript_

## Introduction

This experiement and prototype project was triggered with the question:

> Can you host semi-interactive pages with data on using GitHub pages

I have written about using GitHub Pages previously, but simply for generating homepage rendering of Markdown based content.

## Process

## Result

## Next Step

GitHub Pages is centered around [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), there are newer static site generator, which have evolved from where Jekyll originally _scratched an itch_.

I decided how to start with a _vanilla_ solution.

The next steps I would like to dwelve into experiments/prototypes based on:

1. [Jekyll]
1. [Hugo]
1. [Vue]
1. [React]
1. [Svelte]

These will all be basic proof of concept like projects. At some point I do however want to go deeper, based on me preferred and the best fit candidate for a more proper project.
